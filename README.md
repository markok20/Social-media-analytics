Social media analytics How to research the customer experience from Twitter posts?

How to do a complete Twitter analysis of the customer experience?

How and how can one research the customer experience from customers ’Twitter posts? How had customers reacted, felt, and thought in Twitter messages right after the customer experience or service encounter? Were there as many positive, negative and neutral feelings? What textual data from Twitter messages can tell about negative and positive emotions? What were the most common reasons when customers reported negative emotions. For example, is time related to negative emotions?

I sought answers to these questions. Data from February 2015 were available, containing approximately 15,000 rows of data. Twitter messages were sent by customers of U.S. airlines immediately after the customer encounter.

I went through a wide range of data with sentiment analysis, which categorizes text-based messages, or tweets, by tone. The tone can be either positive, neutral or negative. At the same time, the messages specify emerging themes, ie frequently occurring terms and topics. The aim was to look at the positive and negative experiences and to compare these results between the airlines. How had customers reacted, felt, and thought about the customer experience on Twitter after the encounter? Therefore, the reasons for, among other things, the negative customer experience had been raised in the messages.

Six major US airlines were represented in the data. All airlines received more negative reactions than neutral or positive ones.

Virgin America received almost as many negatives, positives, and neutrals. However, the total number of tweets at Virgin America was significantly lower than at other airlines.

Next, a word cloud analysis of negative sentiments is performed. The larger the word font, the higher the frequency in the text data. Words like canceled, bag, delay, plane, hold, time are among the most common words. But there are also words among them that don’t necessarily mean anything.

Next, a word cloud analysis of positive sentiments will be done. The larger the word font, the higher the frequency in the text data. Words like thank, best, customer, love, Flying, good are among the most common words. But there are also words among them that don’t necessarily mean anything.

Next, a word cloud analysis of neutral sentiments is performed. The larger the word font, the higher the frequency in the text data. Words like thank, flight, ticket, change are among the most common words. But there are also words among them that don’t necessarily mean anything.

Next, the frequencies are calculated. Words like flight, canceled, change are among the most common. But there are also words among them that don’t necessarily mean anything. Most are so-called stop words that need to be filtered out if the analysis is to be taken even further. A list of frequencies is in my Python code.

The next most common causes of negative sentiment are calculated. The main explanatory reason for the negative customer experience was a certain situation related to customer service. The second most common reason was flight delays. The third most common reason was that the respondent was unable to state the exact reason for the negative customer experience. The fourth most common reason was the canceled flight and the fifth was lost luggage during the flight.

A single customer service topic was the most common negative cause in U.S. Airways, United, American, Southwest, Virgin America datasets. Late Flight was the most common negative reason for Delta. Virgin America received the least negative reasons. On the other hand, US Airways, United, American received more than 500 negative reasons, the explanatory factor including a single customer service issue (Customer Service Issue).

Next, it is considered whether the date has a connection to negative sentiments. What will the sentiments look like for the period from Monday, February 16, 2015 to Tuesday, February 24, 2015 for each airline? Sunday was February 22, 2015. Plot less than next sentiments for time periods.

Interestingly, American company’s negative sentiment rose sharply on February 23, 2015, which halved on February 24, 2015. Virgin America has the fewest negative suites, however, keep in mind that Virgin America has the least total number of suites relative to others. The number of negative tweets is skewed from the rest of the week relative to the rest of the week.

Measuring the customer experience has become central to many work communities. Why is it important to measure it? An excellent customer experience pulls sales and growth metrics up. The core of the customer experience is the interaction between the work community and the customer.

The customer experience encompasses the images and feelings that arise for the customer from encounters with community representatives, channels, and services. A good customer experience means that the customer experience meets his or her expectations. A positive customer experience maintains customer loyalty and attracts new customers.

As a result of this analysis, it can be recommended that airlines improve their customer experience if they invested in flight punctuality and customer dialogue in the event of lost goods.
